    <p><i>"Good Day" </i><br><b>Surfaces</b> </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Spent all of our time outside, all day <br>
        Doin' whatever we like, our way <br>
        Didn't need a wall to build a new space <br>
        Every moment just came together like</p>
    <p>Two feet hangin' in the water <br>
        A few trees stood a little taller <br>
        New breeze feels so good <br>
        Can't help but remind me</p>
    <p>That it was a good day (yeah) <br>
        Not much to do but just lay around <br>
        Yeah, it was a good day <br>
        I'm so glad the sun stayed around</p>
    <p>Yeah, it was a good day <br>
        Not much to do but just lay around <br>
        Yeah, it was a good day <br>
        I'm so glad the sun stayed around</p>
    <p>No more school, no more rules <br>
        No more room to feel these blues <br>
        You and views all afternoon <br>
        Look at all the time we don't have to give up</p>
    <p>Everything we're given is enough <br>
        Moments fit together like a glove <br>
        All my questions answered by this, love</p>
